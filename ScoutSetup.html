          Step 1 of 4: Introduction to WARS Scouting Flow

          <p>You're about to tell WARS information about who you have available to scout other teams.  WARS will intelligently generate a list of high-priority matches you should focus on.</p>
          <p>WARS Suggested Matches are: <br /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Easy.  WARS will tell you what matches to focus, but if you can't make one, there will plenty of other valuable matches you can watch.</li>
              <li>Optimized.  WARS optimizes match suggestion using a number of factors, including who's available to scout when and what teams you're interested in.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Before you start, make sure: <br /></p>
            <ul>
              <li>your event has team and match data available on RobotEvents.  WARS works best when the data updates in real-time.</li>
              <li>you know who your scouts will be, their email addresses, and the teams they are competing with (if any) at this tournament.  WARS will email scouts a list of matches they may be able to watch.</li>
              <li>you have sufficient time to complete this process.  At this time, WARS doesn't save your data after each step.  If you close this dialog, you'll lose everything you entered.</li>
